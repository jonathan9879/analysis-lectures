I really liked the visualizations used in the TED Talk.
My favourite being the one with all the words that are different colour depending on if the yare good, neutral or bad, all in the same slide.
The other visualization I really liked was the comparison of potimal times grouped by topic. It was very clear and self-explanatory.

I really liked the speech too. Using the analysis to do a inside joke (etcetera-etcetera) and inviting the public to use the insights was awesome. He clearly got his point across.

The topic in hand wasn't trascendental, but he explained it in a way that made it very interesting and insightfull. 

Maybe the only to-do I would recommend is to ask more to the audience and guet them thinking before giving the answers straight away.
